 <p>Responsive websites for mobile devices and mobile apps seem to be similar, but there are quite a few distinct differences. The most advantage of a responsive web is that developers can save their time and money. They don’t have to create apps for each type of mobile device when they have one responsive website and it makes maintenance cost lower than mobile apps. As a developer, it is easy for updating and bug fixing. As a user, it does not require downloading anything or installing a new version to see the enhancement on the website. While it seems pretty economical and reasonable, it is not as fast or functional as mobile apps. </p>
<p>A mobile app has many advantages over responsive websites so that the percentage of preference to mobile apps is constantly increasing. According to Cherednichenko, almost 90% of mobile traffic belongs to mobile apps. Mobile apps are better than responsive websites in terms of functionality, personalization, and brand recognition. Apps can easily make use of utilizing other mobile device features and supporting functions and tools such as camera, location service, phone calls, and etc. The most fascinating strength of mobile apps is personalization. Users can set up their preferences and notifications. Apps can track and analyze users’ experience and offer customized recommendations based on their location, usage behavior, and interests. Mobile apps usually perform actions faster than web sites because they do not need to load unnecessary elements and they store data locally on users’ mobile devices. They can also offer fundamental functions to users even in offline mode.</p>
<p>Despite these advantages, creating a mobile app could be a struggle for developers who have a limit of time and cost. “Building an application requires a different set of skills than modifying a site for mobile. When done poorly, the great brand awareness present in native apps can work against businesses. (Kris)”</p>
<p>Although the majority of traffic belongs to mobile apps, “the decision to create a mobile website or app depends on your domain, business processes, goals, and other factors like budget and deadline. (Cherednichenko)” When people look for information, they do not rush to the app stores to download apps. They will be more likely to search and gather information with web sites. If you are just starting a business and want to acquire new clients with limited time and budget, the responsive website will be appropriate for you. If you want to attract younger clients with a mobile market and it requires mobile-specific functionality and offline mode, the mobile apps will be suitable for your business.</p>
