 <p>There are many ways to make your website monetize, such as selling ad space, getting paid per click ads, affiliating marketing or selling your own products. For those who are running their own business online that are supposed to sell merchandise or products, it is necessary to add a shopping cart to their websites. An online shopping cart is a software that allows the customers to shop for products from the websites.</p>
<p>Some shopping cart software provides quite basic but only necessary features, such as a checkout page or a button to make a purchase. Other software includes advanced features that allow customers to experience better functionalities and improved services. For example, a virtual cart allows the customers to select multiple items at once before checkout, or they can review the selected items in a view cart page. The owners of websites also get benefited from those software by analyzing what issues their customers are having and proposing a proper solution. </p>
<p>“The most crucial decision in managing an online business is selecting the best available shopping cart for your business. (Builderfly)” Generally, there are three types of shopping cart software that are classified by how they are distributed, how they are added to a website and who is responsible for managing the software. Licensed shopping cart software is developed by a single company that is responsible for the software. Some licenses require a one-time fee for using them and some extra fee for getting updated versions. </p>
<p>An open source shopping cart software is downloadable, released free to use and allows the developers to access the source code easily. Since it is not controlled by a single company but edited by any developers, it also has a drawback that it could be hard to get technical support. The developers themselves are the one who are responsible for obtaining and installing updated versions. Lastly, a hosted shopping cart software also known as a SaaS solution is “a complete package that includes web hosting with the eCommerce software already installed. (Cannon)” This software provides a web-based interface so that the developers themselves do not need to install or update anything. Instead of paying for web hosting, it requires a monthly fee or annual fee depending on the plans with free trials that you could try and see if it works for you.</p>
