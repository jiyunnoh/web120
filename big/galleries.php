 <p>There are so many built-in image galleries that help developers to design and customize their gallery to suit the appearance of their websites. The best galleries are usually created in jQuery but there are a few simple CSS galleries as well. Masonry gallery is one of CSS galleries which is used for collections of images, such as Pinterest, which do not have a fixed height. Some galleries are more used than others due to their responsiveness, functionality, speed and design. According to Nice, the most popular gallery design trend over the last couple of years is sliding horizontal panels also known as Sliders or Carousels. A slider or a carousel is a showcase of images without a popup so users stay on the same page. “It’s a very effective method to increase the web site usability and engage the user. (Nice)” </p>
<p>Blueberry image slider is one of jQuery plugin sliders that was developed specifically for responsive web design. It is an open-source plugin based on a 1140px grid system from cssgrid.net. Elastislide is also one of jQuery plugins that is a responsive image carousel that adapts fluidly in a layout. It can be laid out horizontally or vertically with a selected number of images. A responsive image gallery with a thumbnail carousel using Elastislide is “inspired by Twitter’s user gallery” and they want to implement a responsive gallery “that adapts to the view-port width. (Lou)”</p>
<p>Another popular gallery is a lightbox which pops up the image and shows it bigger when a user clicks an image. One of the Lightbox developed by Elementor, a software company providing web development services, can be set globally or individually. It will automatically affect all galleries by default and if users want to use it for an individual image, they are able to disable it on the global setting. This lightbox is 100% mobile responsive “to make sure visitors from mobile devices get the same consistent experience when using the lightbox feature as desktop visitors do. (Pines)”</p>
<p>There are a lot of galleries that you might not be able to even skim through all of them. You can also combine sliders, carousels or lightbox together with cool effects and easy navigation. Explore various galleries as many as you can to find the best one to fit the feeling of your website.</p>
