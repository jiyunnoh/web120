 <p>Hi. My name is Jiyun Noh. I am originally from South Korea. I acheived a Bachelor's degree in English Literature in South Korea. Now I am studying web development and database in SCC. I haven't decided yet what to pursue as a job between web development and database. I am still figuring out what I am more interested in.</p>
 <p>I studied English language and literature when I went to the university in South Korea. I didn't have any connection with IT field before. In a senior year, I did an internship in a startup related to English education. They were making an application about English vocabularies using Big data. My job was supposed to review English tests and post articles in their website. But I wondered how the application was working and how they created the app. I had a few chances to get to know about it and that is how I started to have interests in this field.</p>

 <p>I am an introvert person who doesn't necessarily need other people to get energy and be happy. It doesn't mean that I don't like being with other people. I do like but also I am the person who can be happy being myself. I like reading books, watching movies, playing video games, cooking, taking a walk, listening to music and eating good food!</p>
 <p>I love eating. Also I like to try new food from other countries. Since I moved to Seattle a year ago, it has been hard to have Korean food, and it made me enjoy trying recipes to cook what I have been craving for. I also like to try to bake things like desserts.</p>
